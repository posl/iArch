Uncertainty can appear in all aspects of software development: uncertainty in requirements analysis, design decisions, implementation and testing.
As the research on uncertainty is so young, there are many issues to be tackled.
Modularity for uncertainty is one of them.
If uncertainty can be dealt with modularly, we can add or delete uncertain concerns to/from models, code and tests whenever these concerns arise or are fixed to certain concerns.

The _iArch-U_ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) has been developed for that purpose.<!-- (double blind test)
 by the members of [Principles of Software Languages (POSL) research group](http://posl.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/index.html)
-->
iArch-U supports software development with controlled uncertainty management processes using an interface description language called _Archface-U_.
Archface-U is a new interface description language designed to enable continuous development of the software, ensuring traceability between software design and implementation.
It is an interface between UML models and Java code described on the iArch-U IDE.

iArch-U also has modelling and coding features which facilitate design and implementation involving uncertainty.
iArch-U is an [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) plug-in, so you can view and edit project assets within an environment tightly integrated with Eclipse.
It also has testing support and model inspection features for testing the software with uncertainty.

For detailed information, please refer to the [documentation](documentation/).
For basic usage of iArch-U, please see the [tutorials](tutorials/).


# System requirements

- Java 8~
- Eclipse Neon~
- Graphiti SDK Plus 0.13~
- Xtext Complete SDK 2.10.0~

Also, if you would like to use the Testing Support function, please install a package below.
- AspectJ Development Tools 4.6~ (development build)

These requirements are not strict.
You might be able to run iArch-U with older versions of middleware and/or libraries.


# Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/posl/iArch/releases) an iArch-U package archive file.
1. Start Eclipse.
1. Select `Help` -> `Install New Software`
  - Select `Add` and `Archive` to designate the downloaded archive file.
  - Uncheck `Group items by category`.
  - Check _iArch Integrated Development Environment_ and proceed to install iArch-U IDE.
  - Install _Graphiti SDK Plus_ and _Xtext Complete SDK_ plug-ins from the Eclipse official site.
  - If you use the Testing Support function, also install a development build of _AspectJ Development Tools_ by updating the URL to one of download sites shown [here](https://eclipse.org/ajdt/downloads/).
1. Restart Eclipse.
