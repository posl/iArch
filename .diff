 In `Archface-U View`, you can check whether an element described in Archcode is uncertain and is already implemented, as a result of type checking.

+## Model checking support
+
+When you need to verify your model, the LTS analyser (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jnm/LTSdocumention/LTSA.html) will help.
+The LTS analyser checks FSP code which represents the model.
+You can generate FSP code from an Archface-U file by selecting `Generate FSP for LTS` from the `iArch` menu of the toolbar.
+Resulting code is displayed in a dialogue, and is saved in the project folder.

+## Generation/synchronisation support among Archface-U, model diagrams and Java code
+
+Every time you add/remove the uncertainty to/from the model, both Archface-U and the model diagrams should be updated simultaneously.
+However, sometimes the relationship among them is disturbed.
+On the other hand, you want to start managing uncertainty on existing (unmanaged) project, or you wish to avoid writing routine phrases for classes you have modelled already.
+
+iArch gives you the functionalities to generate/synchronise Archface-U,  model diagrams, and Java code, by selecting items within the `Synchronize` from the `iArch` menu of the toolbar.
+
+### Model diagrams to Archface-U
+
+When you select `Model -> iArch`, you can generate Archface-U description corresponding to the model diagrams which you chose in the configuration described below.
+
+This feature is the same as the one which is previously provided as `Generate Archface` in the menu, except that the diagram selection by a dialogue is unnecessary.
+
+For example, from a class diagram and a sequence diagram,
+
+![model to Archface-U class diagram](../images/sync_model_arch_1.png)
+![model to Archface-U sequence diagram](../images/sync_model_arch_2.png)
+
+you can get the Archface-U like:
+
+![model to Archface-U result](../images/sync_model_arch_3.png)
+
+
+### Archface-U to model diagrams
+
+When you select `iArch -> Model`, you can generate model diagrams corresponding the Archcode which you chose in the configuration described below.
+
+For example, from an Archface-U,
+
+![Archface-U to model archfile](../images/sync_arch_model_1.png)
+
+you can get class and sequence diagrams like:
+
+![Archface-U to model result 1](../images/sync_arch_model_2.png)
+![Archface-U to model result 2](../images/sync_arch_model_3.png)
+![Archface-U to model result 3](../images/sync_arch_model_4.png)
+
+
+### Java code to Archface-U
+
+When you select `Code -> iArch`, you can generate Archface-U description corresponding to the Java code which you chose in the configuration described below.
+
+For example, from 4 classes in the project, you can get the Archface-U like:
+
+![code to Archface-U result](../images/sync_code_arch_1.png)
+
+
+### Archface-U to Java code
+
+When you select `iArch -> Code`, you can generate Java code corresponding the Archcode which you chose in the configuration described below.
+
+For example, from an Archface-U,
+
+![Archface-U to model archfile](../images/sync_arch_code_1.png)
+
+you can get Java code skeltons like:

 Modularity for uncertainty is one of them.
 If uncertainty can be dealt with modularly, we can add or delete uncertain concerns to/from models, code and tests whenever these concerns arise or are fixed to certain concerns.
